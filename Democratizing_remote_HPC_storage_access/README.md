**Abstract:**
Accessing HPC storage remotely can be cumbersome and involve using out-of-band tools (i.e. NFS, SCP, or SSHFS on Windows or SMB on Linux). We have begun to provide users access to our HPC storage using a tool that enables a familiar interface and behavior - like OneDrive or Dropbox - and unifies access to university-wide storage pools. We will walk through the software, configuration, lessons learned, and next steps in offering this service to our researchers. We are also exploring the use of built-in file tagging and other internal automation to provide a sensitive data workflow for HIPAA-aligned data security. Efficacy and lessons learned from this approach will be discussed.
