**Abstract:**
The Partnership for an Advanced Computing Environment (PACE) at Georgia Tech (GT) has been running two campus- wide cluster resources available for academic courses and workshops for five years. The initial design focused on creating a federated resource for a wide range of educational topics, based on a PACE and College of Computing (COC) partnership. Due to funding, this took the form of separate resources, one funded by PACE, and another by COC. These "Instructional Cluster Environments", PACE-ICE and COC-ICE, became very popular with instructors at GT but led to a high maintenance cost due to the split nature of the environments. With the transition to the Slurm scheduler, PACE collaborated with COC to merge the two clusters into one, ICE. This work details the strategies used to sensibly merge the two production systems, including the storage architecture, shared system policies, and scheduler priority configurations that honor funding complexities.
