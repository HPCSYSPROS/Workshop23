abstract = {There are likely more ideas about the fair way to schedule workloads than there are systems that run those workloads. Possibly more than the number of users of those systems. Unfortunately, since fair is different in different contexts, the optimal solution is unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all, solution, or even an adjustable-size solution where everyone turns a couple of knobs to get the optimal fair solution to meet their need.
I will present GReaT allocations used at the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences, at Penn State University. We provide guaranteed start time expectations and priority scheduling, similar in some respects to condo-like scheduling systems. In addition to start time and resource availability, we provide access to temporary extended resources and protection against rogue or runaway jobs that could drain allocations. Our configuration required additional extensions in
addition to the standard tools provided with slurm scheduling systems.}
